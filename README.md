# DirectoryMonitor

DirectoryMonitor is used to monitor the contents of the provided directory by using a GCD dispatch source. 
It's based on [Apple's example source code](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/Lister/Listings/ListerKit_DirectoryMonitor_swift.html), ported to Swift 3 and slightly improved.
