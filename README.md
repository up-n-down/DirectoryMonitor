# DirectoryMonitor

DirectoryMonitor is used to monitor the contents of the provided directory by using a GCD dispatch source.

## Installation

DirectoryMonitor supports multiple methods for installing the library in a project. You can find the latest version in the [release tab](https://github.com/up-n-down/directorymonitor/releases/latest).

### Installation with Swift Package Manager

To integrate DirectoryMonitor into your Xcode project using [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), specify it in your `Package.swift` file:

``` Swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    [...]
    dependencies: [
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/up-n-down/DirectoryMonitor.git", majorVersion: XYZ)
    ]
)
```

### Installation with Carthage

To integrate DirectoryMonitor into your Xcode project using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```
github "up-n-down/DirectoryMonitor" ~> X.Y.Z
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built DirectoryMonitor.framework into your Xcode project.

## Usage

1. Create a new `DirectoryMonitor` + specify the `URL` that should be monitored
2. Start monitoring and provide an `EventHandler`
3. Enjoy your directory changes ðŸŽ‰

``` Swift
let url = URL(fileURLWithPath: "~/Documents")
let monitor = DirectoryMonitor(at: url)
monitor.startMonitoring {
  print("Directory did change.")
}
```

You can simply stop monitoring your directory with calling `monitor.stopMonitoring()`. That's it. It's that simple to use `DirectoryMonitor`.
